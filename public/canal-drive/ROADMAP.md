# Canal Recall roadmap

## Authentic retro rendering

The selectable theme presets are currently lightweight art-direction previews. A later rendering pass should make the retro modes structurally authentic rather than relying on CSS filters.

- Render the MapLibre scene and game objects into a deliberately low-resolution framebuffer.
- Quantize the framebuffer to a deliberately limited palette, with theme-specific ordered dithering.
- Upscale with nearest-neighbour sampling and preserve hard pixel boundaries.
- Give 8-bit and 16-bit modes distinct native resolutions, palettes, sprite treatments, and HUD typography.
- Add PSX-style vertex jitter, low-precision geometry, affine-looking texture warping, short draw distance, and coloured distance fog.
- Keep collision, routing, labels, and geographic coordinates at full precision; the degradation belongs only in the presentation pipeline.
- Ensure UI and quiz text remain readable, with an accessibility option to exclude instructional overlays from the low-resolution pass.

This can remain a MapLibre-based implementation: capture the WebGL output in a post-processing framebuffer, composite the game layer, apply the selected shader, and then present the upscaled result.

## Optional arcade layer

All overtly game-like systems must live behind one master `Game-y features` toggle. Turning it off should produce a calm, credible navigation-and-recall experience: no pickups, power-ups, streak effects, combo audio, floating points, or arcade obstacles. Difficulty and navigation aids remain independent of this toggle.

Prioritize mechanics that reinforce geographic learning:

1. **Landmark postcards** — collect a postcard by passing a notable place; the route summary becomes a visual travel journal with its name, image, and one fact.
2. **Recall streaks** — consecutive correct street/canal answers build a multiplier and restrained visual trail. A mistake resets the multiplier but never blocks progress.
3. **Discovery tokens** — optional pickups placed at meaningful junctions, bridges, squares, locks, and ferry points rather than arbitrary coordinates.
4. **Perfect-turn bonus** — reward identifying the new feature quickly after a turn, encouraging attention to the transition between named waterways/roads.
5. **Local-knowledge bonus** — extra points for correctly identifying the neighborhood before it is revealed by the HUD.
6. **Route ribbons** — award bronze/silver/gold for recall accuracy, navigation-aid level, and route efficiency, not raw vehicle speed alone.
7. **Exploration collection** — a persistent city album tracks learned waterways, streets, neighborhoods, bridges, and landmarks; newly mastered map labels become the primary progression reward.
8. **Signature landmark models** — keep OSM height extrusions as the city-wide fallback, then replace a curated set of destination buildings with licensed glTF/3D Tiles models. Each model needs source/license metadata, geographic anchor, heading, scale, LOD, and a footprint mask so it replaces rather than overlaps the OSM extrusion.
9. **Street trees and landmark planting** — ingest OSM `natural=tree`, tree rows, and park vegetation into a cached lightweight point layer; render instanced low-poly trees in 3D and simplified crowns in 2D. This is separate from the basemap because standard OpenMapTiles does not consistently ship individual tree nodes.

### Landmark model pipeline

The gray city is not a landmark-model catalog: it is OpenMapTiles building footprints extruded from OSM height data. Signature models should be an additive, curated asset tier:

1. Prefer openly licensed Amsterdam `.glb`/`.gltf` assets (city open-data/BAG/3D Basisvoorziening first); preserve author, source URL, license, and modification notes in a manifest.
2. Normalize each mesh offline, generate at least two LODs, compress it, and record longitude/latitude, ground altitude, heading, and scale.
3. At runtime, suppress the matching OSM footprint and place the model through a MapLibre custom 3D layer. Never draw both geometries.
4. Begin with route destinations where visual recognition matters: Rijksmuseum, NEMO, Maritime Museum, Royal Palace, Westerkerk, and Central Station.
5. Keep normal OSM extrusion as the no-download/failure fallback and apply the same active-landmark highlight state to both representations.
8. **Time and focus power-ups** — limited, legible bonuses such as extra quiz time, one eliminated multiple-choice answer, a brief destination bearing, or a short route-line reveal.
9. **Currents / tailwinds** — route-aware boost zones placed along real-world directional segments; avoid boosts near quiz transitions or tight junctions.
10. **Daily route seed** — the same POI route and assist constraints for everyone, with separate calm and arcade leaderboards.

Avoid mechanics that work against learning: random weapon systems, collisions that interrupt quizzes, opaque loot currencies, collectible spam, or rewards that encourage driving off the mapped network.

The setup screen and live settings panel should expose the master toggle. Individual arcade-system controls can remain in an advanced section if later playtesting shows that they are needed.

### Arcade reference: Crazy Taxi, not GTA

Use Crazy Taxi as the primary reference for pace, readability, and session structure. Borrow GTA-style aids only as optional navigation vocabulary (route line, bearing arrow, minimap), not as the tone or game fantasy.

- Treat important POIs as a rotating set of “fares”: select or collect a passenger/cargo request, learn the destination, navigate there, and immediately receive a nearby follow-on route.
- Make the destination beacon exuberant and readable in arcade mode, while the calm mode keeps the restrained map pin.
- Grade each trip on recall accuracy, route efficiency, discoveries, assist level, and optionally time. Speed alone should not dominate.
- Award meaningful time extensions for correct canal/street answers and efficient arrivals; wrong answers should cost combo/time without preventing completion.
- Build a route chain across neighborhoods so a session naturally teaches spatial relationships between several POIs.
- Let “passengers” be lightweight Amsterdam-flavoured requests—museum visitor, market delivery, ferry connection, canal tour guest—without requiring character simulation.
- Use a destination-category colour language: culture, transit, food/market, civic, park, nightlife, and hidden-history stops.
- Reserve exaggerated arrows, voice barks, combo typography, destination gates, pickups, boosts, and celebratory arrival effects for `Game-y features: On`.
- Add a short “quick fare” mode alongside deliberate study routes. The same map, graph, facts, and recall questions should power both.
- Keep collisions forgiving. The fun should come from flow, turns, geographic decisions, and chaining successful trips—not punishing vehicle damage.
