# Lane: landmarks round 3, the telephone exchange (W Hotel) and the Telegraaf building (2026-11-01, #183)

Branch `lane/landmarks-spuistraat-20261101`, worktree
`/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-worktrees/landmarks-spuistraat-20261101`, dev port 4829.

## Why

The user, after the round-1 and round-2 landmarks: "Vijzelbank and buildings around there might be good to model next in landmarks, keep running landmark lanes through the night." Round 3 lanes take two or three landmarks each, picked for being on ridden centre routes and absent from all three model registries (`manualCatalogue.json`, `manualModels.ts`, `scripts/building-recipes/houses/`), checked by footprint centre (nearest installed model > 35 m away). Check again yourself by pand id before building.

## The landmarks, in order

1. **W Amsterdam / the former telephone exchange**, Spuistraat 175 (1920s municipal telephone exchange by the Publieke Werken, now the W Hotel; the hotel also holds the former KAS Bank at Spuistraat 172 across the street, which is a separate building: model the exchange first, the KAS Bank second if time allows, as separate ids), approx. 52.3718 N, 4.8905 E. Id `telefooncentrale-spuistraat`. Inventory: the brick Amsterdam School block with its stone base and tall vertical bays, the roof-storey set-back and the rooftop bar glazing, the corner, the entrance, the "W" signage. Similar builders: `scheepvaarthuis-builder.ts`, `bungehuis-builder.ts`.
2. **Het Telegraaf-gebouw**, Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 225 (1930, J.F. Staal and G.J. Langhout; Rijksmonument; now offices/shops), the long functionalist block with the glass stair tower on the corner, approx. 52.3716 N, 4.8903 E. Id `telegraaf-gebouw`. Inventory: the horizontal window bands, the glazed corner stair tower, the brick-and-concrete frame, the "DE TELEGRAAF" lettering in its original place if the photos still show it, the shopfronts at street level. Similar builders: `wolkenkrabber-builder.ts`, `het-nieuwe-huis-builder.ts`; use `holedWall.ts` for the ribbon windows.

## Method (same for every landmark lane today)

Read `docs/handoffs/LANE-RULES.md` first, then `docs/START-HERE-buildings.md` §1–§2A (bespoke
landmarks, track A), then `docs/deepseek-modeling-lanes.md` §B5 (the step-by-step recipe) and
`docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §2–§7 (identity, research, elevations, acceptance). Open two
installed builders of a similar kind before writing yours (named per landmark below). Do not open
`TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md` or `buildings-pipeline.md`. Use `/usr/bin/git`. Model: opus.

Hand back when every landmark listed has passed the gates and been looked at, or by **06:00 CET** with whatever has passed, in the order listed. A held model with the
reason written down is a valid outcome; a wrong model is worse than the plain box. Do the
landmarks in the order listed; if the first is not through `audit:glb` by 21:00, finish it and
report the second as not started.

Per landmark:

1. **Identity.** BAG pand id(s) and address (PDOK BAG WFS or the tiles under
   `public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), build year, architect, what stands there
   today. Check nobody did it already: `grep -n "<id or pand>"
   src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json`, `ls scripts/landmarks | grep -i <name>`,
   `/usr/bin/git log --oneline origin/main -i --grep "<name>" | head`.
2. **Photos, open data only.** `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/landmark-brief.ts
   --pand=<pand> --id=<id>` writes the brief and the inventory skeleton from the city panoramas
   (CC BY 4.0). Add Wikimedia Commons photographs (check each file's licence) and the Beeldbank
   where the panoramas miss a side. No Google or Apple imagery, no downloaded meshes. Archive the
   photo references the way `docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §3 says (the source-data repo at
   `MAP_RECALL_SOURCE_DATA=/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-source-data`; the integrator commits
   it, so write the refs into your worktree's `staging/landmarks/<id>/sources.md` and say so).
3. **Inventory first.** `<id>-inventory.json`: every relief, sculpture, sign, clock, crest,
   lantern, turret, dome, lettering and distinctive window order the photos show, with the
   photo it comes from. The Hoofdbureau's coat of arms was missed once; the user checks this.
4. **Measure, then build.** `<id>-footprints.json` from BAG/3DBAG, `<id>-elevations.json`
   (openings per storey per wall, from the photos), `<id>-spec.json`, then
   `scripts/landmarks/<id>-builder.ts` using `BuildingTools` (`cultural-builders.ts`) and
   `house-geometry.ts`. Every material has a `materialSlot` and a measured `tint`
   (`docs/LOOK.md` "Palette and saturation"). Budget: < 40,000 triangles, < 500 KB, no textures.
5. **Register.** One entry in `src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json` (footprint
   centre/heading/length/width, `surveyed.source`, attribution with licences, `suppressOsmIds`)
   and one dispatcher line in `scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts`. Export:
   `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts --only=<id>`, then
   `npm run build:landmark-lods -- --only=<id>`.
6. **Gates.** `npm run audit:glb -- --id=<id>`, `npm run check:landmark-inventory -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:manual-landmarks`, `npm run compare:facades -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:osm-under-models`, `npm run test:building-taxonomy`, `npm run lint`.
   Never loosen a gate, baseline or threshold.
7. **Look at it.** Dev server on your port (`PORT=<port> nohup npx tsx server.ts > /tmp/<id>-dev.log 2>&1 &`;
   stop it by the port's PID). `npm run review:sheet -- --id=<id> --inventory --port=<port>`
   through `bash /tmp/canal-pw.sh` (one Playwright run on the machine at a time; name the spec,
   never a directory). Then `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/ingame-capture.ts --id=<id>
   --port=<port> --views=<street>:<bearing>,...` (desktop + phone, also through the lock) for
   the What's New note. Judge the sheet beside the photo per wall: window order, crown, colour,
   the inventory items. Fix what the photo contradicts before calling it done. Likeness to the
   photo is the bar, not gates passing.
8. **Commit** per landmark on your branch (builder, JSONs, catalogue entry, dispatcher line, the
   GLB and its lod1). Never push, never merge, never touch `game.js`, `index.html`,
   `package.json`, lockfiles, `public/canal-drive/js/*` bundles, `models/covers.json`,
   `landmark-backlog.json`, goldens, baselines, `TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `whats-new-notes.json`.
   The other landmark lanes tonight append to the same catalogue and dispatcher; append at the
   end, touch nothing else in those files, and the integrator union-merges.

## Report

LANE-RULES hand-back block, plus per landmark: pand id, tris, KB, audit result, the sheet path,
the in-game shot paths (desktop and phone), what the photos show that the model does not, and
the holds with reasons. INTEGRATOR TODO: `npm run build:canal-signature-landmarks`, covers
(`node --max-old-space-size=8192 --import tsx scripts/build-covers.ts
--tiles=public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), `npm run check:covers`, backlog regen
(`scripts/landmarks/build-poi-backlog.ts`), the source-data refs to archive.
