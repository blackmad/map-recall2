# Lane: two centre schools, Barlaeus Gymnasium and Academie van Bouwkunst (2026-11-01)

Branch `lane/landmarks-schools-20261101`, worktree
`/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-worktrees/landmarks-schools-20261101`, dev port 4812.

## Why

The user wants ten new landmark buildings in the game by the end of today; six lanes take two
each. Both of these rank high in `docs/reports/landmark-targets-20261029.md` (ride visibility,
81 and 173 sampled routes) and were sent to the bespoke track because their 19th-century fronts
carry the likeness; neither has a model.

## The landmarks, in order

1. **Barlaeus Gymnasium**, Weteringschans 29–31 (1885, W. Springer, neo-renaissance; a
   gemeentelijk monument). Pand to verify: BAG 0363100012169565. Approx. 52.3621 N, 4.8835 E,
   facing the Weteringschans across from the Rijksmuseum side. Id `barlaeus-gymnasium`.
   Inventory: the symmetrical front with the central entrance bay and its gable, the red brick
   with stone bands and window surrounds, the "BARLAEUS GYMNASIUM" lettering, the roof with its
   dormers and the ironwork on the ridge if the photos show it. Similar builders:
   `oudemanhuispoort-builder.ts`, `conservatorium-builder.ts`, or any school in
   `scripts/landmarks` (`ls scripts/landmarks | grep -i school`).
2. **Academie van Bouwkunst**, Waterlooplein 211–213 (the former Oudezijds Huiszittenhuis
   of 1654 with its courtyard, behind the Mozes en Aäronkerk; verify the pand, the report names
   BAG 0363100012171994 and the crop shows stepped gables). Approx. 52.3675 N, 4.9024 E. Id
   `academie-van-bouwkunst`. Inventory: the gables to Waterlooplein and the courtyard, the
   brick and stone details, the entrance, any lettering. Similar builders: `trippenhuis-builder.ts`,
   `oost-indisch-huis-builder.ts`.


## Method (same for every landmark lane today)

Read `docs/handoffs/LANE-RULES.md` first, then `docs/START-HERE-buildings.md` §1–§2A (bespoke
landmarks, track A), then `docs/deepseek-modeling-lanes.md` §B5 (the step-by-step recipe) and
`docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §2–§7 (identity, research, elevations, acceptance). Open two
installed builders of a similar kind before writing yours (named per landmark below). Do not open
`TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md` or `buildings-pipeline.md`. Use `/usr/bin/git`. Model: opus.

Deadline: hand back by **22:30 CET today** with whatever has passed. A held model with the
reason written down is a valid outcome; a wrong model is worse than the plain box. Do the
landmarks in the order listed; if the first is not through `audit:glb` by 21:00, finish it and
report the second as not started.

Per landmark:

1. **Identity.** BAG pand id(s) and address (PDOK BAG WFS or the tiles under
   `public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), build year, architect, what stands there
   today. Check nobody did it already: `grep -n "<id or pand>"
   src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json`, `ls scripts/landmarks | grep -i <name>`,
   `/usr/bin/git log --oneline origin/main -i --grep "<name>" | head`.
2. **Photos, open data only.** `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/landmark-brief.ts
   --pand=<pand> --id=<id>` writes the brief and the inventory skeleton from the city panoramas
   (CC BY 4.0). Add Wikimedia Commons photographs (check each file's licence) and the Beeldbank
   where the panoramas miss a side. No Google or Apple imagery, no downloaded meshes. Archive the
   photo references the way `docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §3 says (the source-data repo at
   `MAP_RECALL_SOURCE_DATA=/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-source-data`; the integrator commits
   it, so write the refs into your worktree's `staging/landmarks/<id>/sources.md` and say so).
3. **Inventory first.** `<id>-inventory.json`: every relief, sculpture, sign, clock, crest,
   lantern, turret, dome, lettering and distinctive window order the photos show, with the
   photo it comes from. The Hoofdbureau's coat of arms was missed once; the user checks this.
4. **Measure, then build.** `<id>-footprints.json` from BAG/3DBAG, `<id>-elevations.json`
   (openings per storey per wall, from the photos), `<id>-spec.json`, then
   `scripts/landmarks/<id>-builder.ts` using `BuildingTools` (`cultural-builders.ts`) and
   `house-geometry.ts`. Every material has a `materialSlot` and a measured `tint`
   (`docs/LOOK.md` "Palette and saturation"). Budget: < 40,000 triangles, < 500 KB, no textures.
5. **Register.** One entry in `src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json` (footprint
   centre/heading/length/width, `surveyed.source`, attribution with licences, `suppressOsmIds`)
   and one dispatcher line in `scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts`. Export:
   `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts --only=<id>`, then
   `npm run build:landmark-lods -- --only=<id>`.
6. **Gates.** `npm run audit:glb -- --id=<id>`, `npm run check:landmark-inventory -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:manual-landmarks`, `npm run compare:facades -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:osm-under-models`, `npm run test:building-taxonomy`, `npm run lint`.
   Never loosen a gate, baseline or threshold.
7. **Look at it.** Dev server on your port (`PORT=<port> nohup npx tsx server.ts > /tmp/<id>-dev.log 2>&1 &`;
   stop it by the port's PID). `npm run review:sheet -- --id=<id> --inventory --port=<port>`
   through `bash /tmp/canal-pw.sh` (one Playwright run on the machine at a time; name the spec,
   never a directory). Then `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/ingame-capture.ts --id=<id>
   --port=<port> --views=<street>:<bearing>,...` (desktop + phone, also through the lock) for
   the What's New note. Judge the sheet beside the photo per wall: window order, crown, colour,
   the inventory items. Fix what the photo contradicts before calling it done. Likeness to the
   photo is the bar, not gates passing.
8. **Commit** per landmark on your branch (builder, JSONs, catalogue entry, dispatcher line, the
   GLB and its lod1). Never push, never merge, never touch `game.js`, `index.html`,
   `package.json`, lockfiles, `public/canal-drive/js/*` bundles, `models/covers.json`,
   `landmark-backlog.json`, goldens, baselines, `TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `whats-new-notes.json`.
   The other five landmark lanes today append to the same catalogue and dispatcher; append at the
   end, touch nothing else in those files, and the integrator union-merges.

## Report

LANE-RULES hand-back block, plus per landmark: pand id, tris, KB, audit result, the sheet path,
the in-game shot paths (desktop and phone), what the photos show that the model does not, and
the holds with reasons. INTEGRATOR TODO: `npm run build:canal-signature-landmarks`, covers
(`node --max-old-space-size=8192 --import tsx scripts/build-covers.ts
--tiles=public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), `npm run check:covers`, backlog regen
(`scripts/landmarks/build-poi-backlog.ts`), the source-data refs to archive.
