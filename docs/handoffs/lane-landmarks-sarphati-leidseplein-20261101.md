# Lane: landmarks round 4, Oranje-Nassau Kazerne on the Sarphatistraat and the DeLaMar theatre on the Marnixstraat (2026-11-02, #193)

Branch `lane/landmarks-sarphati-leidseplein-20261101`, worktree
`/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-worktrees/landmarks-sarphati-leidseplein-20261101`, dev port 4839.

## Why

The user: "keep running landmark lanes through the night". Two recognisable modernist landmarks on ridden routes (the Stadionplein by the Olympic Stadium; the NDSM quay), checked by footprint against installed models (nearest > 90 m) and by pand id before building.

## The landmarks, in order

Confirm every identity fact below from the BAG and nl.wikipedia before building; the integrator wrote them from memory and earlier briefs were wrong twice (addresses, architects).

1. **Oranje-Nassau Kazerne**, Sarphatistraat 400–700 (the very long early-19th-century barracks block along the Singelgracht, now apartments and offices; the brick front with its regular window order, the central pavilion and end pavilions), approx. 52.3650 N, 4.9170 E. Id `oranje-nassau-kazerne`. Find the pand(s) by footprint and confirm nothing is installed within 35 m (`oosterkerk` and the Marinekazerne are neighbours; grep the catalogue for "kazerne" and "sarphati"). The Sarphatistraat is ridden. Inventory from the panoramas: the window order per storey and bay, the pavilions' pediments, the roof form from the orthophoto, the lettering and plaques. Budget: it is about 300 m long; keep under 40,000 tris by instancing the bay. Similar builders: `marinekazerne-kattenburgerstraat` (landed 2026-11-02), `droogbak-builder.ts`, `holedWall.ts`.
2. **DeLaMar theatre**, Marnixstraat 402 at the Leidseplein (the 2010 theatre by Arno Meijs behind the retained 1947 front of the former Volksgebouw/De La Mar; the stone front with its tall windows, the marquee and lettering), approx. 52.3635 N, 4.8800 E. Id `delamar-theater`. Confirm the pand and build years; check nothing is installed within 35 m (`american-hotel`, `stadsschouwburg` and the Leidseplein models are neighbours). Inventory: the front's window order, the marquee, the lettering, the roof-level fly tower behind. Similar builders: `stadsschouwburg` builder, `carlton-hotel-builder.ts`, `holedWall.ts`.

## Method (same for every landmark lane today)

Read `docs/handoffs/LANE-RULES.md` first, then `docs/START-HERE-buildings.md` §1–§2A (bespoke
landmarks, track A), then `docs/deepseek-modeling-lanes.md` §B5 (the step-by-step recipe) and
`docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §2–§7 (identity, research, elevations, acceptance). Open two
installed builders of a similar kind before writing yours (named per landmark below). Do not open
`TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md` or `buildings-pipeline.md`. Use `/usr/bin/git`. Model: opus.

Hand back when both landmarks have passed the gates and been looked at, or by **18:00 CET** with whatever has passed, in the order listed. A held model with the
reason written down is a valid outcome; a wrong model is worse than the plain box. Do the
landmarks in the order listed; if the first is not through `audit:glb` after five hours, finish it and
report the second as not started.

Per landmark:

1. **Identity.** BAG pand id(s) and address (PDOK BAG WFS or the tiles under
   `public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), build year, architect, what stands there
   today. Check nobody did it already: `grep -n "<id or pand>"
   src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json`, `ls scripts/landmarks | grep -i <name>`,
   `/usr/bin/git log --oneline origin/main -i --grep "<name>" | head`.
2. **Photos, open data only.** `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/landmark-brief.ts
   --pand=<pand> --id=<id>` writes the brief and the inventory skeleton from the city panoramas
   (CC BY 4.0). Add Wikimedia Commons photographs (check each file's licence) and the Beeldbank
   where the panoramas miss a side. No Google or Apple imagery, no downloaded meshes. Archive the
   photo references the way `docs/landmark-building-recipe.md` §3 says (the source-data repo at
   `MAP_RECALL_SOURCE_DATA=/Users/blackmad/Code/map-recall2-source-data`; the integrator commits
   it, so write the refs into your worktree's `staging/landmarks/<id>/sources.md` and say so).
3. **Inventory first.** `<id>-inventory.json`: every relief, sculpture, sign, clock, crest,
   lantern, turret, dome, lettering and distinctive window order the photos show, with the
   photo it comes from. The Hoofdbureau's coat of arms was missed once; the user checks this.
4. **Measure, then build.** `<id>-footprints.json` from BAG/3DBAG, `<id>-elevations.json`
   (openings per storey per wall, from the photos), `<id>-spec.json`, then
   `scripts/landmarks/<id>-builder.ts` using `BuildingTools` (`cultural-builders.ts`) and
   `house-geometry.ts`. Every material has a `materialSlot` and a measured `tint`
   (`docs/LOOK.md` "Palette and saturation"). Budget: < 40,000 triangles, < 500 KB, no textures.
5. **Register.** One entry in `src/canalRecall/landmarks/manualCatalogue.json` (footprint
   centre/heading/length/width, `surveyed.source`, attribution with licences, `suppressOsmIds`)
   and one dispatcher line in `scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts`. Export:
   `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/build-manual-landmarks.ts --only=<id>`, then
   `npm run build:landmark-lods -- --only=<id>`.
6. **Gates.** `npm run audit:glb -- --id=<id>`, `npm run check:landmark-inventory -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:manual-landmarks`, `npm run compare:facades -- --id=<id>`,
   `npm run check:osm-under-models`, `npm run test:building-taxonomy`, `npm run lint`.
   Never loosen a gate, baseline or threshold.
7. **Look at it.** Dev server on your port (`PORT=<port> nohup npx tsx server.ts > /tmp/<id>-dev.log 2>&1 &`;
   stop it by the port's PID). `npm run review:sheet -- --id=<id> --inventory --port=<port>`
   through `bash /tmp/canal-pw.sh` (one Playwright run on the machine at a time; name the spec,
   never a directory). Then `node --import tsx scripts/landmarks/ingame-capture.ts --id=<id>
   --port=<port> --views=<street>:<bearing>,...` (desktop + phone, also through the lock) for
   the What's New note. Judge the sheet beside the photo per wall: window order, crown, colour,
   the inventory items. Fix what the photo contradicts before calling it done. Likeness to the
   photo is the bar, not gates passing.
8. **Commit** per landmark on your branch (builder, JSONs, catalogue entry, dispatcher line, the
   GLB and its lod1). Never push, never merge, never touch `game.js`, `index.html`,
   `package.json`, lockfiles, `public/canal-drive/js/*` bundles, `models/covers.json`,
   `landmark-backlog.json`, goldens, baselines, `TODO.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `whats-new-notes.json`.
   The other landmark lanes tonight append to the same catalogue and dispatcher; append at the
   end, touch nothing else in those files, and the integrator union-merges.

## Report

LANE-RULES hand-back block, plus per landmark: pand id, tris, KB, audit result, the sheet path,
the in-game shot paths (desktop and phone), what the photos show that the model does not, and
the holds with reasons. INTEGRATOR TODO: `npm run build:canal-signature-landmarks`, covers
(`node --max-old-space-size=8192 --import tsx scripts/build-covers.ts
--tiles=public/data/extracts/amsterdam/bag-tiles/14`), `npm run check:covers`, backlog regen
(`scripts/landmarks/build-poi-backlog.ts`), the source-data refs to archive.
